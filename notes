Martin Atelier's make file

to get it to work:
had to change arduino install directory in perl program
had to change specify ARD_PORT manually and delete line in makefile
  this caused a problem using stty where it had no port name

basics: make your own makefile that includes Arduino.mk 
remember to add to ARD_LIBS when adding libraries
  may need to add includes manually in sketch this way?

seems like includes are added manually. Right now I'm adding absolute paths.


TODO:
  consider configuration struct instead of scattered globals.
  consider baud rate negotiation or setting correctly at startup.
  errors may need to flush both sides buffers and start a resync sequence.
